🔍 Here's a breakdown of the dashboard I designed and developed:

📌 Page 1 – 𝐎𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬
 A high-level overview showcasing key performance indicators like total bookings, total revenue, active properties, and occupancy trends. Added interactive slicers to filter data by city, booking status, and property type to enable quick and intuitive data exploration.

💰 Page 2 – 𝐑𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐞 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬
Dived deep into revenue distribution across properties and cities. Tracked revenue contribution by booking platforms (like OTA vs direct), and analyzed revenue leakage due to cancellations, no-shows, and early checkouts. Visualized revenue trends over time to spot seasonality and growth opportunities.

📆 Page 3 – 𝐁𝐨𝐨𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬
Focused on booking behaviours — from source channels and check-in/check-out patterns to guest preferences and no-show rates. Built dynamic charts that help stakeholders identify booking peaks, channel efficiency, and operational bottlenecks.
